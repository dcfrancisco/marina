# Introduction

Clipper-2025 is the modern resurrection of Nantucket/CA Clipper — not by imitation, but by **continuing the true evolution of Clipper 5.x**, exactly where Computer Associates stopped and failed to finish.

This Handbook contains:

* the **full language specification**
* the **programming manual**
* the **VM specification**
* the **module architecture**
* the **database engine design**
* the **macro system**
* and the long-lost **CA Clipper roadmap** finally completed

The goal is simple:

> **Clipper reborn as a modern VM-based language,
> yet still feeling like the Clipper you used in the 1990s —
> but without the baggage of xBase.**

It is clean.
It is elegant.
It is future-proof.
It is *your* language.
